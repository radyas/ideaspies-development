      <strong>Scope</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes our policy and practices regarding our collection, use and disclosure of information.
    </p>

    <p>
      We understand that providing information online involves trust on your part. We take this trust very seriously, and make it a high priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal information you provide to us when you visit this website.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>In General</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      We receive and store any information you enter on this website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can be used to identify you as an individual or to contact you directly (&#8220;<strong>personal information</strong>&#8220;).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Automatic Collection of Information </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      We automatically collect some information from your computer or device when you visit Idea Spies. For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, web browser software, and referring website. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed, pages visited, and searches. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests and preferences of users and customise your user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Location Information and Other Information from Devices</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use an application on a device, we will collect and use information about you in generally similar ways and for similar purposes as when you use the IdeaSpies platform. In addition, we may collect information about your location if you have instructed your device to send such information to the application via the privacy settings on that device, or if you have uploaded photos tagged with location information. We may use the location information collected from your device or photos to enhance your use of the application by providing you with relevant content and contextual advertising. You can change the privacy settings of your device at any time, in order to turn off the functionality to share location information with the application and/or the functionality to tag your photos with location information. If you have any queries about the privacy settings of your device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your device or your mobile service provider for help.

      <strong>Cookies and Other Web Technologies</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      We may collect information via cookies and other similar technologies, such as web beacons. Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your Internet browser. Cookies contain basic information about your Internet use.

      We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our website receives. This information does not contain any personal information about you and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.

    <p>
      <strong>How Long We Keep Your Information </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      We may retain certain information associated with your account in our archives, including for analytical purposes as well as for record keeping integrity. The periods for which we retain your information depend on the purpose for which we collected it and we use it.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements. We may retain some information for a period of time after you have closed your account with us, for instance if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend or establish legal rights.
    </p>
